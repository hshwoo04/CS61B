Explain anything interesting that you might have observed above:

Generally the when the inputs were in order, the time increased with the exception of the
Truest. This is probably mainly due to the fact that random inputs often does not
have to travel to the bottom of the tree or list, while the ordered inputs need to
compare themselves to the very end of the tree/list. The TreeSet does not need to do 
these types of comparisons and therefore does not differ in time between the random and the in order inputs.
